## Exploring Data
I think I made some mistake somewhere with the calculations although the problem worked out, it seems that the answer is incorrect. I also got a bit confused with line_price and line_cost, and how they are used to find out the profit. I simply made profit = total sales - cost. I should have also counted for operating expenses I suppose.
